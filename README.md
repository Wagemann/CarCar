## Sales microservice - Nick Wagemann 

The Sales Microservice has four models. One the automobile value object that polls data from Automobile in the inventory models and lets me gain access to the vin number from inventory to use in the sales microservice. The employee model is used to create an employee and the customer model is used to create a customer. The Record Model is reliant upon the other three models to generate records that will have each of them listed within.

I created views that give the ability to get list, view details of specific items, update particular items, delete specific items, and post new items for the employee, customer, and record model.
